This repo will be populated with both source code and binaries for projects, one-by-one.

Each one of them will have a blog post or something alike, duplicated in its own README.txt file.

If you find iteresting stuff here, feel free to use it.

Some day, it will be here ~50 projects or so... all functional and many of them useful (at some degree).
